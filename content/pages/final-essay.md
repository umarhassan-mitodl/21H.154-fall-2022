## Tokugawa Japan and the Past, Present, and Future of Samurai

Since the late 19th century, many Japanese and non-Japanese observers have come to think of Tokugawa Japan as synonymous with Japan's “pre-modern” past, for better and for worse. 

**In your third and final essay, you are asked to explore one aspect of Tokugawa Japan and analyze it by considering the entire breadth of the histories and ideas we’ve covered in class during the semester.** In other words, you are asked to dig deeper into one key theme or aspect of Tokugawa Japan (everyday life, politics, culture, religion, etc.) and compare it to the previous periods in Japanese history. If relevant, you may also consider the subsequent evolution of your chosen topic in the modern era (1868–).

Your essay should focus on a single, book-length or similarly substantial primary source. The primary source can either be a larger portion of one of the assigned sources we have discussed in class or may be an entirely new source. The primary task for this paper is to analyze the selected primary source using contextual information provided by in-class lectures, discussions, assigned readings, and at least one additional chapter- or article-length scholarly source. Your primary source and outside secondary source(s) should be chosen in consultation with the instructor.

If you are taking this class as a Japanese-language option subject (21G.554), you are required to incorporate at least one Japanese language primary or secondary source into this essay. The source should be chosen in consultation with the instructor. When you submit your final paper, you are also required to submit a translated abstract (300–500 words) of your source.

## Major Steps

**Step 1:** Conceptualize and decide on the main subject of your research.

- It might be helpful to start by looking through the assigned texts in the syllabus.

**Step 2:** Decide on the main source that you will analyze.

- William Elliot Griffis, [*The Mikado's Empire, Vol. 2, Personal Experiences, Observations, and Studies in Japan, 1870–1874* (1876)](https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Mikado_s_Empire/Ld_BNvbt3MgC?hl=en&gbpv=1). First-hand account of an American hired to teach in early Meiji Japan. Especially recommended chapters: Ch. 1 "First Glimpses of Japan" through Ch. 3 "In Tokio, the Eastern Capital" and Ch. 15 "The Last Year of Feudalism" in Japan. 

**Step 3:** Find and select at least one chapter- or article-length scholarly sources that you will use to analyze your main source.

- If your main source has an “Introduction” or bibliography, those might be good places to start finding suggestions for additional scholarly sources.
- Look at the “Sources and Suggestions for Further Reading” sections at the end of the *Japan Emerging* chapter you’re interested in. It typically lists major historical and secondary sources that you might choose to read in depth.
- Each entry in the *Samurai: An Encyclopedia of Japan's Cultured Warriors* book also has a “further reading” section at the end that lists additional sources.
- Talk to your instructor!
