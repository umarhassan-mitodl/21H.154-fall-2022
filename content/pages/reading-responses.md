## The World of Murasaki Shikibu and Sei Shōnagon

Murasaki Shikibu and Sei Shōnagon were contemporaries to each other. In fact, they served two rivaling consorts of Emperor Ichijō. In her diary, Lady Murasaki had this to say about her palace colleague and fellow writer:

> "Lady Sei Shōnagon. A very proud person. She values herself highly, and scatters her Chinese writings all about. Yet should we study her closely, we should find that she is still imperfect. She tries to be exceptional, but naturally persons of that sort give offence. She is piling up trouble for her future. One who is too richly gifted, who indulges too much in emotion, even when she ought to be reserved, and cannot turn aside from anything she is interested in, in spite of herself will lose self-control. How can such a vain and reckless person end her days happily!"

For this response post, write one 200–300-word paragraph that identifies a major theme in the writings of Murasaki Shikibu and Sei Shōnagon that strikes you as especially important or puzzling. As you do so, mention at least one specific passage of either of their writings (including the page #).

This response is due during session 5.

## Close Reading: “The Battle of Dan no Ura”

1. Quote a phrase or a short passage (at most a few sentences) from "The Fight at Dan no Ura" reading that strikes you as EITHER a) especially important OR b) intriguing but also puzzling.
2. In one or two sentences, briefly explain why you chose that particular passage.

We will use your post as a basis for an in-class exercise.

This response is due during session 7.

## Your Favorite Sengoku Samurai Rule

Once you've completed the required readings for week 5, post the following:

- Quote one samurai precept or law from either 
    1. "The Seventeen-Article Testament of Asakura Toshikage" (pp.429–431) or
    2. Takeda Nobushige's "Ninety-Nine-Article Testament" (pp. 431–432).
- Explain in a short paragraph why this passage strikes you as particularly interesting, revealing, and/or puzzling, especially in comparison to the other "laws" and "codes" we have discussed in this class until now.

## Class Annotation Exercise: “Part IV, The Tokugawa Peace” 

For week 7's annotation exercise, we will annotate the same set of texts ("Code for the Warrior Households" and "Code for the Imperial Court and Court Nobility," from *Sources of Japanese Tradition, Volume 1: From the Earliest Times to 1600 (Second Edition),* pp. 12–18) as a class. Please do so as instructed below:

1. First read through the two sets of laws.
2. Highlight TWO articles of law by choosing ONE from each of the two sets of laws.
3. For each of your two laws, explain why, to the best of your knowledge, you think it might help the Tokugawa Shogunate consolidate its rule over Japan. If you have any questions or misgivings about the law, you may also note that in the comment.
4. If someone else has already chosen to annotate your preferred law, choose another one that hasn't been chosen yet!

## Historical Perspectives on the Akō Incident

Session 13's reading from the *Samurai Encyclopedia* offers various competing, historical perspectives that emerged in response to the actions of those who were involved in the Akō Incident. While you are expected to read all of these perspectives, each student has been assigned one particular perspective to highlight in this discussion thread. Carefully read your assigned perspective and post a short paragraph that summarizes its main arguments in your own words. We will use this as a basis for a "role-play" discussion during session 14.

This response is due during session 13.

## Locating Tsuneno's Edo

For this set of readings, identify one geographical location **within or near the city of Edo** that is mentioned in Stanley's *Stranger in the Shogun’s City* (**\*please make sure to cite the page # in which the location appears**). This could be a particular neighborhood, estate, shrine, street, or any other places that are mentioned in the chapters of the book. In a few sentences, describe the significance of the place as described in the book. If there's a particularly useful and effective passage in the book, you may quote Stanley's words at the end of your post.

**\*\*\*Each post should discuss a separate location, i.e. if someone else has posted on a site you planned to discuss, you'll need to find a new site for your own post.\*\*\***

This response is due during session 16.

## Group Annotation: *The Autobiography of Baron Chōkichi Kikkawa* 

We will annotate *The Autobiography of Baron Chōkichi Kikkawa* as a class. Please do so as instructed below:

1. Read through the ENTIRE document FIRST. In particular, don't miss the discussion on the "House law" towards the end.
2. AFTER you've read through the Autobiography, highlight TWO passages:
    1. A passage that, in your view, reflects Kikkawa's identity as a samurai.
    2. A passage that, in your view, reflects Kikkawa's transformation into a post-samurai identity.
3. For each of your two highlighted passages, briefly explain your choice using the comment function.
4. \*\*\*If someone else has already chosen to annotate your preferred passage, **choose a different passage!**
