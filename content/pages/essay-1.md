## Close Reading and Analysis of Historical Sources

For this essay, choose one\*\*\* of the 5 sets of historical sources we have discussed in class that, in your view, contains a key theme that is especially important for us to understand the social, cultural, and/or political experiences of the inhabitants of the Japanese archipelago during the period preceding the rise of the first samurai government in 1185.

In the essay, make the case for your argument by **citing specific examples from your chosen set of historical sources**. Back up your analysis and claims about the historical sources by **citing specific passages from the** ***Japan Emerging*** **(JE) readings as well as points made during in-class lectures and discussions.** 

This essay is designed to be completed with in-class materials. Do not cite outside sources beyond the required or optional materials listed in the {{% resource_link "7f543041-3658-4cb1-96fe-904d6956eb24" "Readings" %}} section.

**A note on why it is critically necessary to cite from both the historical AND scholarly sources (JE, lectures) in order to write a successful piece of historical analysis:**

1. If you only cite the JE readings or the lecture, your essay is, in the end, only a summary of those scholarly works. You need to directly engage with and cite from the historical sources in order to present your own interpretation of history.
2. If you only cite from the historical sources, you are unable to evaluate and validate your personal interpretation of these sources. Citing scholarly sources transforms your interpretation of historical sources from something that is purely subjective into an informed opinion that is backed up by existing scholarship.
3. Citing scholarly sources will also help you avoid key errors like selecting historical sources that do not match your arguments, misreading historical texts, and applying anachronistic ideas to historical actors or events.

\*\*\*Even as you place your primary focus on one set of historical sources, you may also cite from a historical source from another set as long as it is relevant to your main argument. For example: if you focus on Option 4 (shōen documents), you may choose to cite additional examples from the section on Taika reforms within Option 2. If you're unsure as to how relevant your chosen sources are for your main argument, please feel to contact the instructor for advice.

- Is **my organization** clear? Does each point lead into the next, without irrelevancies and without anticlimaxes?
- Is **each paragraph** unified by a topic sentence or topic idea?
- Are my sentences concise, clear, and emphatic? Are needless words and inflated language eliminated?
